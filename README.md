A drag and drop block-based coding environment for front-end web technologies.

## Project Goal
The goal of Elemental is to act as a bridge between [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and front-end web technology. Any and all design decisions will focus on being easy to pick up, while still retaining all of the major aspects of text-based code, thus creating what might be thought of as "a highly accessible bridge that leads to the perfect ending location".


### Dev Notes
If you're an Elemental Dev, be sure to read the [Dev Notes](https://github.com/ElementalCode/Elemental/wiki/Dev-Notes) to get up to speed on the rules and regulations for creating with the ElementalCode team. Happy coding! :)
